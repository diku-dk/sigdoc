This documentation tool provides documentation for the basis library
subset implemented by the [MLKit](http://elsman.com/mlkit) and
available packages, which may be fetched with the
[smlpkg](http://github.com/diku-dk/smlpkg) package manager.

Some of the documentation specified for modules in the basis library
is borrowed from the [Standard ML Basis
Library](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/index.html)
documentation. A physical book specifying the Standard ML Basis
Library is also available [1].
